<title>Better Enums - Clean Reflective Enums for C++</title>

<meta name="description" content="Clean, reflective enums for C++11. Conversions
    from/to string, constant list, and compile-time operations. Natural syntax
    and a high degree of type safety. Generator-free in typical usage. The
    library is header-only and easy to install. Since most operations are
    constexpr, they can be used in your own compile-time code. The library
    depends only on the standard library and one type of compiler extension. It
    is therefore almost entirely standard C++. This page is a tutorial." />

    <p>
      Have you noticed the awkward situation with enums in
      <span class="cpp">C++</span>? Built-in <code>enum class</code> is missing
      basic features, such as string conversion. There are several approaches to
      address this, but most seem to involve unnatural syntax or code
      repetition. See some <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/201593/is-there-a-simple-script-to-convert-c-enum-to-string">here</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Better Enums gives you rich, reflective enums with the nicest syntax yet
      seen.<sup><a href="#note">1</a></sup> All you have to do is add two short,
      simple header files to your project, and you are ready to go.
    </p>

    <pre>#include &lt;enum.h&gt;
ENUM(Channel, int, Red, Green, Blue);</pre>

    <p>
      This gives you an <code>int</code>-sized enum type with all sorts of
      reflective capacity, including string conversions, value listing,
      compile-time operations, static information about the range of declared
      constants, and (last and probably least) the name <code>"Channel"</code>
      itself.
    </p>

    <p>
      The enum is easy to maintain. There is no duplication of value names,
      no repetition of cumbersome macros, and no generator to run on every
      build. The library is header-only, so there aren't any object files to
      link with.
    </p>

    <p>
      Better Enums is free, available under the BSD license. The
      author is committed to further development and support, so please
      <a href="mailto:antonbachin@yahoo.com">contact me</a>, open an issue on
      <a href="https://github.com/aantron/better-enums">GitHub</a>, or ask a
      question on Stack Overflow.

    <h2>Installation</h2>

    <p>
      Download the
      <a href="https://github.com/aantron/better-enums/releases/latest">
        latest release</a>, then copy the files
      <code>enum.h</code> and <code>enum_preprocessor_map.h</code> to your
      project. That's it! Just make sure both files are in your include path and
      you are compiling with <span class="cc">gcc</span> or
      <span class="cc">clang</span> in
      <span class="cpp">C++</span><span class="eleven">11</span> mode.
    </p>

    <p>
      <span class="cc">msvc</span> support is coming in a near-future version
      with some enum features disabled. This is because
      <span class="cc">msvc</span>'s support for <code>constexpr</code> is
      lagging.
    </p>

    <p>
      Create a file and put this code in it:
    </p>

    <pre>#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;enum.h&gt;

ENUM(Channel, int, Red, Green, Blue);

int main()
{
    Channel   my_channel = Channel::Green;
    std::cout
        &lt;&lt; "Channel "
        &lt;&lt; my_channel.to_string()
        &lt;&lt; " has value "
        &lt;&lt; my_channel.to_integral()
        &lt;&lt; std::endl;

    return 0;
}</pre>

    <p>
      Compile and run, and you should see the output
      <samp>Channel Green has value 1</samp>. Congratulations! You have compiled
      your first Better Enum.
    </p>

    <hr />

    <p>
      Values are assigned to Better Enums just like to regular
      <span class="cpp">C++</span> enums. That means you can change the enum
      above to something like this:
    </p>

    <pre>ENUM(Channel, int, Red, Green = 5, Blue, Last = Blue);</pre>

    <p>
      and the result would be just as you'd expect: <code>Red</code> is 0,
      <code>Green</code> is 5, <code>Blue</code> is 6, and <code>Last</code> is
      also 6.
    </p>

    <hr />

    <p>
      There is no need for <code>Last</code>, however. Every Better Enum comes
      with a built-in value called <code>_last</code>. So, if you have
    </p>

    <pre>ENUM(Channel, int, Red, Green, Blue);</pre>

    <p>
      Then <code>Channel::_last</code> is <code>Channel::Blue</code>! In fact,
      <code>Channel</code> also gets <code>_first</code>, <code>_min</code>,
      <code>_max</code>, <code>_span</code>, and <code>_size</code>. These
      built-in values have underscores so that you can define your own enums
      without having to worry about naming problems:
    </p>

    <pre>ENUM(Position, int, first, last, other);</pre>

    <hr />

    <p>
      You already saw how to convert an enum to a string or an integer. As you
      might guess, it is also possible to go the other way:
    <p>

    <pre>Channel   my_channel = Channel::_from_string("Blue");
Channel   my_channel = Channel::_from_integral(2);</pre>

    <p>
      If your code tries to convert an invalid string or integer to a
      <code>Channel</code>, it will get an <code>std::runtime_error</code>
      exception.
    </p>

    <hr />

    <p>
      You can iterate over all the declared values of an enum:
    </p>

    <pre>for(Channel channel : Channel::_values)
    std::cout &lt;&lt; channel.to_string() &lt;&lt; std::endl;</pre>

    <p>
      and directly over their names with <code>Channel::_names</code>.
    </p>

    <hr />

    <p>
      Finally, most of the above is declared <code>constexpr</code> and can be
      run at compile time. This means you can do all sorts of parsing and
      processing at the same time the rest of your code is being compiled,
      improving runtime and startup performance! See some
      <a href="https://github.com/aantron/better-enums/blob/master/example/4-constexpr.cc">examples</a>
      and another
